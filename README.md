# Hi, I'm Nino Filiu

I create pictures, programs, music, and other things too, but since you're on my Github, let's focus on my work as a professional nerd!

🎓 I've studied computer science with a focus on security at Telecom Paristech, Eurecom and Technische Universität Berlin. I also explored machine learning, quantum computing, and many other fields (I am very very curious)

🚀 I co-created Sensafety and worked for Synomia, 360Learning, and Toucan Toco, where I am currently. I did frontend, mobile, backend, and serverless development. More informally, I also did a few people and brand's website: [clairefrances.fr](https://clairefrances.fr/), [significatif.org](https://www.significatif.org/) (not yet released, but it's gonna be beauuutiful), [e-do.studio](http://www.e-do.studio/), and of course [ninofiliu.com](https://ninofiliu.com/).

🧑‍🔬 I genuinely love to code so I did a ton of personal projects. Some are very stupid, remember when I [ported Flappy Bird to a CLI](https://github.com/ninofiliu/flappy-bird-cli)? Yeah well sometimes I do less stupid stuff, like [oa-client](https://github.com/ninofiliu/oa-client), downloaded hundreds of times per week and used by my company. I also often write POCs to explore new web architectures, like [this pattern](https://github.com/ninofiliu/contract-driven-api) that allows for a safer and simpler client-server communication.

👪 I am actively part of the web community: I like helping others learning how to code, and that led me to having [over 7K reputation points](https://stackoverflow.com/users/8186898/nino-filiu) on Stack Overflow, I also taught several classes via Google Meet on how to create art with programming, and I wrote a few articles like [Sleeping In JavaScript](https://medium.com/@nino.filiu/sleeping-in-javascript-e00a1ebbde2e). I also frequently go to meetups, and went to DotJS 2019. Oh yeah, and I star in a [this Honeypot documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8IiKepT0r8).

🌍 I hold a wide array of beliefs

- Individuals and interactions > processes and tools
- Accountability > authority
- Substance, content > format, wording, style
- Developers are morally obligated to use their work for the greater good
- Computer science degrees are virtually useless
- A composition of small pieces of software is better than one big software
- There future of the web is native
- Webpack has been overused and should be replaced by Snowpack or Vite in most cases
- I don't care about space vs tab

(these are the compact/extreme version of them, they're obviously more nuanced, youknowwhatimsaying)
