# Hi, I'm Nino Filiu

I create digital experiences through the use of technology

This can manifest in many forms but basically I know how to

- write programs that process & generate videos, images, and sounds
- engineer interactive digital installations
- code full stack web applications
- create video games
- +1000s unrelated skills (music producing, tattooing, quantum physics knowledge, photography, etc)

& I'm open for work involving using these tech skills for creative purposes
